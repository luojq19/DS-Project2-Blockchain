#### TBD:

- [ ] Node behaviours and interactions
- [ ] public or permissioned
- [ ] Block contents
- [ ] How to maintain the blockchain, use what data structure (link list?)
- [ ] Network? How to simulate
- [ ] Choices of consensus algorithm: PoW?
- [x] SHA256: go package 'crypto/sha256'
- [ ] should the system only contain miner nodes or also include consumer-only node (do not generate new blocks)
- [ ] How to implement transactions?

#### 

#### Functions of the blockchain system (basics)

- [ ] A new node can join in the decentrailized system
- [ ] Nodes can form a network and communicate with each other
- [ ] All the nodes in the system can reach consensus (consensus protocol)
- [ ] A node is able to generate new blocks
